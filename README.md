Rush is a bash script that executes other bash scripts from compatible GitHub
repositories or local folders.

See [this minimal rush repo](repo), or a real life example
repo at [DannyBen/rush-repo][1].

Rush was designed to easily allow bootstrapping of new linux machines with 
your desired configuration and installed packages.

Rush was developed using the [Bashly Command Line Framework][2].

Building your own Rush repository
--------------------------------------------------

You can fork [my rush repository][1], and edit it to your needs, or follow 
these instructions to create one from scratch.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, named `rush-repo`.
2. Each folder you create in this repository is considered a package.
3. Each package needs to have an executable script named `main`, and
   optionally a plain text file called `info`.
4. In the `main` script, you have the environment variable `$REPO` available
   to you, in case you need it (for example, if you want your script to run 
   another script in the same repository).
5. Note that your `main` script is executed in the same folder it lives in,
   so you can copy files from its directory to wherever they need to be.
