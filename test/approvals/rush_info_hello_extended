This is a simple example.

It just tests that rush is connecting to the repository properly, and
receives the environment variables.

This info file can be accessed by running

  $ rush info hello

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "What's the rush?"
echo "REPO:      $REPO"
echo "REPO_PATH: $REPO_PATH"
echo "USER_CWD:  $USER_CWD"
